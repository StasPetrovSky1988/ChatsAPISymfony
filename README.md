<h1 align="center">Chat's API service</h1>
This project provides an API for data exchange. For example, it could be chat messages or messages from your sensors or other data that you want to transfer between other devices. It's actually stack storage where you can pass data and then receive that data. I am developing this project for my experience with the Symfony framework and I would appreciate if you could help me with this. This project is currently under development.
